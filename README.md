# VismaBookManager
This project uses .Net 5 and creates a console application that can add/remove books and borrow/return books using JSON files. 

## Requirements
.Net 5 and MS Unit

## Setup 
The setup for this application is fairly straightforward.
 1. In `/VismaBookManager/bin/Debug/net5.0` there will be generated 2 files: Books.Json and BorrewdBooks.json. If you want to add your own Book library import it to the path mentioned before.
 2. Compile the application and choose what you want to do.

## Extension
 1. It is possible to extend this application to a Web application by using the interfaces that are created in advance.
 2. DTO can be expanded by using created interfaces.
